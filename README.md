Spinning Snake - second life for all time classic game
Snake is almost 40. It was cloned many times, but core rules remained about the same...<br/>
<b>Spinning Snake</b> takes modern approach...<br/>
<i>The goal is to make the snake shorter and shorter until it completely disappears.</i><br/>
&bull; The snake is navigated using taps. Each tap makes the snake to turn right.<br/>
&bull; Color of eaten food matters! If it matches the color of the head, the snake will become shorter, otherwise - longer.<br/>
&bull; The snake can cross itself or borders.<br/>
&bull; The goal has to be accomplished within limited time depending on the level.<br/>
&bull; Currently there are 40 levels: 5 major ones with 8 sub-levels each.<br/>
&bull; The complexity (time limit, food amount, snake speed, penalties) starts from very easy and gradually increases to almost impossible.<br/>
&bull; Results can be published on speed and progress leaderboards.<br/>
The game is free, ad supported, ads are not intrusive - shown only during breaks.<br/>
